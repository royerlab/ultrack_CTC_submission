## Documentation

The `ultrack` library relies on a configuration schema, its description is [here](ultrack/config/README.md).

The segmentation and tracking data are stored in a SQL database, described [here](ultrack/core/README.md).

Helper functions to export to the cell tracking challenge and napari formats are available, [reference](ultrack/core/export).
